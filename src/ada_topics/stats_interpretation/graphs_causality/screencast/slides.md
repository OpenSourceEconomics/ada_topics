### Applied Data Analytics

<br/>

# Data analysis â€” Interpretation challenges

### Graphs & Causality

<br/>

Hans-Martin von Gaudecker and Aapo Stenhammar

---

# Graphs & Causality

- Graphs encode sense of direction

- Data description alone **never** does

---

# Inferring causality

- Necessary condition: We have a DAG

  _Implies that framework is not immediately constructive for supply and demand_

  <br/>

- No forks on any path from cause to effect ("no confounders")

```mermaid {theme: 'neutral', scale: 1.5, htmlLabels: false}
flowchart LR
    X ~~~ U ~~~ Y
    U(U) --> Y
    U --> X
    X(X) --> Y(Y)
```

# Inferring causality

- Necessary condition: We have a DAG

  _Implies that framework is not immediately constructive for supply and demand_

  <br/>

- No forks on any path from cause to effect ("no confounders")

  _Could in principle solve via including all confounders in a multiple regression_

  $$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1, i} + \beta_2 X_{2_i} + \ldots + \beta_k X_{k_i} + U_i$$

  _but the world is too complex for that._
