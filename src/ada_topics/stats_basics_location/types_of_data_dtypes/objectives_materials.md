# Types of data and data types

Please note that this page appears in both the chapters "Statistics â€” Basics & location"
and "Pandas Basics". This is because the topic is relevant to both the general
understanding of data and the specific implementation in Pandas.

## Learning objectives

After working through this topic, you should be able to:

- determine the correct description of a given data column

  - nominal
  - cardinal
  - ordinal

- explain how these categories map into Pandas data types:

  - unordered categorical
  - floating point
  - integer
  - ordered categorical

## Decision tree

This is the decision tree for the "correct" form of data. Just because a variable
arrives as a number, it does not mean that you should think about it as numerical data.
Very often this happens when categories are encoded as numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 2 meaning
$[0,
30,000)$, $[30,000, 60,000)$, $[60,000, \infty)$, which would be described in some
metadata).

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A -->|"`Yes`"| C("`Numerical?`")
    A(Ordered?) -->|No| B("`Unordered
    Categorical`")

    C -->|"`Yes`"| E("`Continuous?`")
    C -->|"`No`"| D("`Ordered
    Categorical`")

    E -->|"`Yes`"| G("`Floating
    point`")
    E -->|"`No`"| F("`Integer`")

    style A fill:#FFE5B4
    style C fill:#FFE5B4
    style E fill:#FFE5B4
```

Note that for numerical data, you still have to decide whether a variable is measured on
a cardinal or ordinal scale. Both are possible for continuous or discrete data, it is
not embedded in the Pandas data type.
