# Measures of Central Tendency: More properties

## Learning objectives

After working through this topic, you should be able to:

- explain what a reduction operation is
- explain why you can go back and forth between totals and averages, but not between
  totals and medians / modes.
- explain why the median is invariant under monotonic transformations, while the mean is
  only invariant to positive affine transformations.
