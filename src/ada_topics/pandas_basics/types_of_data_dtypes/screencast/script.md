# Script: Types of data and data types

## Introduction

When we asked "What do we mean by data?", we discussed that in this course, we will
focus on structured data.

Just because your data is structured, it does not mean that this structure is sensible,
i.e., matches the content of the data.

In this video, I will discuss the correct data types

1. in verbal-mathematical form and
1. their implementation in Pandas

Setting categorical data types in pandas is a little bit tricky, we will have a separate
video on that. But I want you that you know already at this point that it exists.

## Ordinal, numeric data

Question here is about the "true" form of the data. Whether the actual label is
numerical, who cares?

Good thing about almost always using categories for nominal data is that it restricts
the types of operations you can do on the data. This is a good thing because it prevents
you from doing things that don't make sense.
