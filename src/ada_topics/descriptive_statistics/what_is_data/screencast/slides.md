# Our def

_Great idea -- but let's move to a different screencast of how we think about data_

- Example: ...
- Def: Anything that can be measured (?)
- Math: Notation typically $$x_i$$, $$x_{k,i}$$ etc.
- Computer Science: Arrays, lists, **dataframes**, etc.
- Human eye / mind: Tables and plots

Objective: Understand all these are ways to represent the same thing

_Chapter for this is not obvious! "Background" or so?_

- Data can often be represented as a collection of observations of a variable.

- For example, think of the heights of students in a class. Call this variable $X$, and
  let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_N$ be the heights of the students in the class (who are a
  total of $N$ students).

- We can think of this as a dataset, or in statistical notation, a sample of size $N$.

# Representing a Series of Data
