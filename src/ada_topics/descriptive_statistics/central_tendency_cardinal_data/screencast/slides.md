# Descriptive Statistics

### Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Mode and Median

<br>

Hans-Martin von Gaudecker and Aapo Stenhammar

### Cardinal Data

Cardinal data is the data type used for counting
- Cardinal numbers provide a way to measure and compare the "size"
- The distance between two cardinal values has a precise meaning

Examples of cardinal data are:
- Number of students in a class
- Height and weight of individuals
- Revenues, costs and margins of a company

Example of NON-cardinal numerical data:
- Utility: While the utility generated by a utility function has an ordinal meaning, its numerical value has no meaning

### Example Data

| Country | GDP per capita ($)|
| ----------- | ----- |
| Argentina           | 13,731   |
| Bolivia           | 3,701   |
| Brazil           | 10,044   |
| Chile           | 17,093   |
| Colombia           | 6,980   |
| Ecuador           | 6,533   |
| Guatemala         | 5,798 |
| Paraguay           | 6,260   |
| Peru           | 7,790   |

### Median

<div>

| Country | GDP per capita ($) |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Bolivia           | 3,701    |
| Guatemala         | 5,798 |
| Paraguay           | 6,260    |
| Ecuador           | 6,533    |
| **Colombia**        | **6,980**    |
| Peru           | 7,790   |
| Brazil           | 10,044    |
| Argentina           | 13,731    |
| Chile           | 17,093    |

- **Intuition**: the median is _the value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data_

- To compute the median sort the data and find the _middle value_ (what happens if the values
  are an even number?)

- Can be computed for any type of _ordered_ data (numerical and ordinal)

- In our case, the median is observed at the 5th position, which is $6,980

### Mean

  - **Definition**: The mean is _the sum of all the values in the sample divided by the total number of values_

- In our case, it is computed by:

    $$
    \text{mean} = \frac{13,731 + 3,701 + 10,044 + ...}{9} = 8,658
    $$

- Can be computed *only* for cardinal data

### Mean vs Median: sensitivity to outliers.

- The mean is more sensitive to outliers than the median. Why?

- After ranking as the top tourist destination for the next year, Guatemala's GDP per capita is expected to spike to approximately $10,000

- The mean changes to $9,125, while the median remains more stable ($7,790)

- Note: if the shock would have affected a country in the top half of the distribution, the median wouldn't have changed

### Summary

| Statistic | Sensitivity to outliers | Type of data | Aggregation to higher level |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Mean      | High                    | Cardinal    | Sum of all values / N |
| Median    | Low                     | Cardinal, ordinal | Middle value |
| Mode      | Low                     | Cardinal, ordinal, categorical | Most frequent value |
