# Measures of Central Tendency: Cardinal Data

This topic builds very heavily upon [](#types-of-data-dtypes-des-stats). Make sure you
have fully grasped the contents of that one.

## Learning objectives

After working through this topic, you should be able to:

- Come up with examples of cardinal data
- Explain why we can calculate mean, median, and mode for cardinal data
- Calculate the mean, median, and mode for pandas series
- Explain why the mean is more sensitive to outliers than the median
