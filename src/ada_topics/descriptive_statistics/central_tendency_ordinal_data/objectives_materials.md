# Measures of Central Tendency: Ordinal Data

This topic builds very heavily upon [](#types-of-data-dtypes-des-stats). Make sure you
have fully grasped the contents of that one.

## Learning objectives

After working through this topic, you should be able to:

- Come up with examples of ordinal data
- Explain why we can calculate the median and mode for ordinal data
- Explain why it is pointless to calculate the average for ordinal data
- Calculate the median and mode for pandas series
- Explain why the `.median()` method does not work for pandas series.

## Materials
