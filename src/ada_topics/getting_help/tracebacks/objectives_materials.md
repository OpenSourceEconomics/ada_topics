# Python tracebacks

Please note that this page appears in both the chapters "Descriptive Statistics" and
"Pandas Basics". This is because the topic is relevant to both the general understanding
of data and the specific implementation in Pandas.

## Learning objectives

After working through this topic, you should be able to:

- Read Python tracebacks and focus on the important parts
  - What type of error occurred?
  - Where did it happen?
  - What exactly did happen?
