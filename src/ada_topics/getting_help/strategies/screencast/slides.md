# Web search vs. local information

| Local information                                | Web search                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Can be very concise                              | All the information you <br/> may want to have |
| Usually easy to find                             | Can be hard to retrieve what you want          |
| Documentation of the object you are working with | Might not apply to your version of a library   |
| Need to have an object in memory                 | Can look for possible ways to do things        |
