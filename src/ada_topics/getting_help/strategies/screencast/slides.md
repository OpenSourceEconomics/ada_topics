# Web search vs. local information

| Local information                           | Web search                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Can be very concise                         | All the information you may want to have     |
| Usually easy to find                        | Can be hard to retrieve what you want        |
| Documentation of the object in front of you | Might not apply to your version of a library |
| Need to have an object in memory            | Can look for possible ways to do things      |
