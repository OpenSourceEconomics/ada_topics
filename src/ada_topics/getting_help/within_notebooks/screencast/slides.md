# Web search vs. local information

| Web search                                     | Local information                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| All the information you <br/> may want to have | Can be very concise                              |
| Can be hard to retrieve what you want          | Usually easy to find                             |
| Might not apply to your version of a library   | Documentation of the object you are working with |
| Can look for possible ways to do things        | need to have the object in memory                |
