# Screencast: Equivalence Scales

## Problem

- Scale effects: Here not in production, but in households
- Shared apartments: Only one kitchen, one bathroom (leads to conflicts sometimes, but
  it's cheaper)

## Solution: Scales

- Weight based on the number of adults and the number of children
- Divide by that weight to obtain equivalence income (income per person)
- Characteristics:
  - Single household gets a weight of 1
  - Scale economics: Each additional household member consumes something (> 0), but less
    than the first (\< 1)
  - Second "derivative": The third child costs less than the first (if \< 0) or the same
    amount (if = 0)
  - Adults and children are sometimes treated equally (equality sign) or children have
    lower additional costs
- Where do the numbers come from?
  - Estimated from data (consumption models)
  - Then heuristic formulas
  - An example: Square root of the number of household members

## New OECD Scale

- Currently standard
- "Adult" from 14 years
- Perfection will never be achieved, comparability is more important; for "normal"
  households, there is no huge difference
- Nice and simple
