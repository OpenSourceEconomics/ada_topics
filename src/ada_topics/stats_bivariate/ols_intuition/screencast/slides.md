# Linear conditional mean function

- Given that I know $X$, what is the mean value of $Y$?

- Linear relationship:

  $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot X + U$$

- Divides each $Y_i$ into two parts:

  - Systematic part (conditional mean): $\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot X_i$

  - Residual / unobserved part: $U_i$

# OLS: Setup

Rewrite

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot X_i + U_i$$

as

$$U_i = Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 \cdot X_i$$

and pick $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ as to minimize a total distance of the $U_i$

---

# OLS: Setup

"pick $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ as to minimize a total distance of the $U_i$":

- Total: Sum

- Criterion: Squared distances

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1) & = \argmin_{b_0,b_1} \: \sum_{i=1}^{n} U_i^2 \\
&= \argmin_{b_0,b_1} \: \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(Y_{i}-b_0-b_1 X_{i}\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

# OLS: Why that setup?

Optimal in the sense of providing the "Best Linear Unbiased Predictor"

- Best: Cannot do better in the class of linear unbiased predictors

- Linear: Functional form is $a + b \cdot X$

- Unbiased: Wait for the Statistics course

- Predictor: Estimate for $\bar{Y} | X$

Proof is beyond the scope of this course

---

# OLS: Hugely important

- Easily extends to multiple $X$, non-linear relationships, etc.

- Basis for huge amount of other statistical methods

- Will only scratch the surface here

- Large part(s) of econometrics course(s) will be spent on this model
