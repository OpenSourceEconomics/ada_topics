# Script: Scalar types

## Contents

- It might look like these scalar types are not relevant for economics but they form the
  basis for many things that come later
- All we do here is very intuitive; We do it to establish a precise vocabulary for
  talking about Python variables
- Example to explain types: Just like different types of boxes are used to store
  different kinds of items (e.g., a jewelry box for rings, a shoe box for shoes),
  different types of variables are used to store different kinds of data.
- Explain what "scalar" means (scalar as opposed to vector)
- Explain int and float in the "what is a variable type" slide
