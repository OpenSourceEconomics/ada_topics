# Learning Objectives

Two screencasts out of this:

_(assigning)_

- Assign variables in Python
- Do simple manipulations with variables
- Compare variables

would be without much background, e.g. a > 5 or c = b \< a, see output True/False
without thinking much about it

_(types)_

- List several built-in types in Python _(float, int, Boolean, string)_
- Explain why not all operations are possible with all types

# Script

[Old one](https://electure.uni-bonn.de/static/mh_default_org/engage-player/6aa0b00c-298f-48d9-a9ad-afc5ccb865ac/872f2264-bf69-4d43-b767-512b0f8ca291/8682e6e5-462b-4ab2-bf3d-f2085d723978.mp4)
is good.

# Additional Materials

[Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html) of Python built-in
types

# Quiz

If you need to represent a real number, in Python you would use ...

- F Boolean
- F Int
- T Float

Which of the following are properties about floats?

- F The can represent any real number in a given interval
- F They can represent arbitrarily large numbers
- T They can be used for scientific calculations
- T They can be added to integers

Of which type is 1.0?

- F Boolean
- F Int
- T Float

How can you calculate the square of the variable "a"?

- F a^2
- F a\*\*a
- T a\*a
- T a\*\*2

Which values can a Boolean take?

- True
- False
- false
- true

If a = True and b = False, then

- T not a is False
- F a and b is True
- F a and not b is False
- T a or b is True
