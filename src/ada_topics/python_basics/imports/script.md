# Script: Imports

## Why base python is not enough

- Python is a great language, but it comes with a limited set of built-in functions.
- You can do sums, divisions, etc. ...
- But if you want to take the log of a number, there is no built-in function for that.

## How do we solve this?

- We can import libraries that have the tools we need.
- Libraries are python code that someone else has written and made available for us to
  use.
- We can import these libraries into our code and use the functions they contain.

## Example: log function with numpy and math

## Syntax on how to import libraries

- import library as alias
- from library import something

### Notes to us:

- It seems a bit hard to explain this without explaining functions at all (it's a bit
  hard to explaining what exactly we import). For now, I would do this implicitly (we
  use the term but don't tell them exactly what it is).
