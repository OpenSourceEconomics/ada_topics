# Variable Assignment and Basic Calculations

## Learning objectives

After working through this topic, you should be able to:

- Assign values to variables in Python
- Do simple calculations with numbers and variables

## Materials

Here is the
[screencast](https://electure.uni-bonn.de/paella7/ui/watch.html?id=176954c0-e2e7-4887-bbb3-9b0c3edef294).
These are the [slides](python_basics-assignment_calculations.pdf).

If you want to get a deeper understanding of the differences between variables and
values, you may find it helpful to run little code snippets through the
[Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/). It will visualise what happens in Python's
memory when you execute a piece of code.
