# Script: Pitfalls

- Create different python cells in which the following operations are performed:

  - `a = 2`
  - `print("Mark's income is", a)`
  - `a = 3` (highlight that the variable is overwritten)

- Now execute the print cell again and show that it's different

- Execute and delete the first cell

- Execute the print cell: Still 2, although the cell is not there anymore

- Restart kernel and execute the print cell again
