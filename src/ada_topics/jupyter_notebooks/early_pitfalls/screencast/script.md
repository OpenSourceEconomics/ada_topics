# Script: Pitfalls

- Create different python cells in which the following operations are performed:

  - `a = 2`
  - `b = 3`
  - `a + b`
  - `a = 7.0` (highlight that the variable is overwritten)

- Now execute the addition cell again and show that it's different

- Execute and delete the first cell

- Execute the addition cell: Still 10.0, although the cell is not there any more

- Restart kernel and execute the print cell again
