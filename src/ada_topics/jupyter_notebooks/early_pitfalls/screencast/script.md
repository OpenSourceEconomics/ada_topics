# Script: Pitfalls

- Create different python cells in which the following operations are performed:
  - a = 2
  - Print("Mark's income is",a)
  - a = 3 (highlight that the variable is overwritten)
  - Now execute the print cell again and show that it's different
  - Restart kernel and execute the print cell again. Show that a is not defined
