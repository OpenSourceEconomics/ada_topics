# Script: Opening Notebooks - starting a JupyterHub client from eCampus

## Intro

- Jupyter Notebooks are the main tool for data analytics in Python in the corporate
  world
- Notebooks are useful because:
  - you can have immediate feedback after running a cell
  - you can include nicely formatted text between python cells (next screencasts).
- We use JupyterHub. There are other options, but you will be on your own.

## Getting there

- Ecampus page -> JupyterHub -> show contents -> start my server
- Describe user interface of JupyterLab (files on the left, and launch new things)

## First steps

- To start: launch notebook and rename "first_steps". Describe extension ipynb
- Fill a cell with print("hello world") (mentioning that they don't need to understand
  the content) and execute it (mentioning that there is another screencast where \
  we go
  into details of execution)
