# Script: Pitfalls

- Create different python cells in which the following operations are performed:
  - a = 2 and return a
  - return a
  - a = 3 (highlight that the variable is overwritten)
  - return a (in a new cell, and show that also the previous one returns 3)
  - Restart kernel and show that a is not defined
