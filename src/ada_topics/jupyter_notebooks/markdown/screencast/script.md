# Script: Create and execute cells

- Source texts is marked up (like the in the old days where someone would scribble in
  the margin what it should look like)
- Markdown makes the source easy to read as well
- Extensions make it just as powerful as other markup languages (I am writing scientific
  papers and websites in that)

## Reformat text to what it looks like on the website

- Two (!!!) newlines make a paragraph break
- Minus signs make bullet points
- Stars make italics *(doubled up: bold)*
- Numbers followed by dot make numbered lists

\# Learning objectives

It is important that you understand why you are doing things â€” i.e., the goals of your
activities. The activities in this course:

- attending lectures,
- watching videos,
- reading articles and other materials,
- completing quizzes,
- and, of course, working on the assignments

are all deduced from the learning objectives. These are things that you should be able
to do after performing one or more of these activities. *(Of course, full mastery may
take more time.)*

The learning objectives come at two levels: the course level and the weekly level. At
the course level, we group them into five categories:

1. Descriptives statistics,
1. programming techniques,
1. interpretation challenges,
1. personal skills,
1. social skills.

At the weekly level, we only list the learning objectives for descriptive statistics and
programming techniques. Listing the objectives for getting a sense of interpretation
challenges would mean giving away the solutions to the assignments. The objectives in
terms of personal and social skills would simply be too repetitive at the weekly level.

Please familiarise yourself with the learning objectives for the course and come back to
them every now and then to see how you are progressing. Every week, please start with
going through the objectives before the lecture.
